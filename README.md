# 🧠 Sign Language Detection using OpenCV & MediaPipe

A real-time Sign Language Detection system that leverages **OpenCV** for image processing and **MediaPipe** for hand tracking. This project captures video input, detects hand landmarks, and interprets sign gestures into readable text — bridging communication gaps for the deaf and hard-of-hearing.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time video capture using webcam
- Hand landmark detection with MediaPipe
- Gesture recognition using pre-defined sign mappings
- Translates recognized signs into text
- Lightweight and accessible solution using Python

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **OpenCV** – for video capture and image processing
- **MediaPipe** – for real-time hand landmark tracking
- **NumPy** – for array operations
- **Tkinter (optional)** – for basic GUI (if implemented)

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NabhyaIoT2026/Sign-Language-2.git
   cd Sign-Language-2
2. **Run the application**
   python Application.py
